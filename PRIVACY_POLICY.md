# Privacy Policy for AI One-Click Rewrite

**Last updated:** August 10, 2024

## Introduction

AI One-Click Rewrite ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Information We Collect

### No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users. Our extension operates entirely within your browser and does not send any data to our servers.

### Local Storage Only
The extension stores the following information locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API:
- API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- User preferences and settings
- Custom writing instructions
- Extension configuration

This data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any external services.

## How We Use Information

### Extension Functionality
The extension uses your locally stored settings to:
- Connect to your chosen AI provider
- Apply your preferred writing styles
- Remember your custom instructions
- Provide a personalized user experience

### Text Processing
When you use the text rewriting feature:
- Selected text is sent directly from your browser to your chosen AI provider
- No text content is stored or transmitted to our servers
- All processing occurs between your browser and the AI provider you've configured

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

### AI Providers
The extension communicates directly with AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) using your API keys. These providers have their own privacy policies that govern how they handle your data.

### No Third-Party Sharing
We do not share, sell, or transmit any user data to third parties except for the direct communication with AI providers when you explicitly request text rewriting.

## Data Security

### Local Storage
All user data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage API. This ensures that your information remains on your device and is not accessible to external parties.

### API Key Security
Your AI provider API keys are stored locally and encrypted by Chrome's storage system. We never have access to these keys or any data processed through them.

### No Server Communication
Our extension does not communicate with any servers we control. All external communication is limited to your chosen AI providers when you explicitly use the text rewriting feature.

## Permissions and Access

### Required Permissions
The extension requires the following permissions to function:

- **contextMenus**: To provide right-click menu options for text rewriting
- **activeTab**: To access selected text on the current webpage
- **scripting**: To inject content scripts for text replacement
- **storage**: To save your preferences locally
- **notifications**: To provide feedback during text processing
- **Host permissions**: To work across all websites you visit

### Limited Access
The extension only accesses webpage content when you explicitly select text and choose to rewrite it. No content is accessed without your direct action.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Data Control
You have complete control over your data:
- All settings can be modified or deleted through the extension options
- API keys can be removed at any time
- The extension can be uninstalled to remove all local data

### Opt-Out
You can stop using the extension at any time by:
- Disabling the extension in Chrome
- Uninstalling the extension
- Clearing your browser data

## Children's Privacy

Our extension does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The extension is designed for general use and does not target children specifically.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by:
- Updating the "Last updated" date
- Posting the new Privacy Policy in the extension
- Notifying users through the Chrome Web Store

## Data Retention

Since we do not collect or store any user data on our servers, there is no data retention period. All user data is stored locally in your browser and is subject to your browser's data management policies.

## International Data Transfers
